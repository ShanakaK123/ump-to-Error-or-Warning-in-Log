# Jump-to-Error-or-Warning-in-Log
 When viewing a log file on the server, we can toggle on/off Info, Warn, and Error. An improvement would be to add controls that allow the user to jump to the first Warn or Error in the log, and then keep clicking on the control to jump to the next one.

like this improvement a lot: when troubleshooting, I will often toggle the buttons to sort by only warnings or errors. But it is not uncommon to need to know what happens in the log before the entry to determine what might be the cause of an issue.To me, it doesnâ€™t feel like that much of difference if I search via the browser or via our own search method. Unless our own search method allows us to jump to the next warning or error without needing to type a specific part of the warning ( Guy van der Kolk added a comment - 22/Jul/20 2:13 PM )
